# GetBestFoodItem
User should be able to write a restaurant name, it should return list of all the names that are matching. The user should then be able to choose a restuarant name and see the menu and their ratings.             User should be able to write a menu item, get the best item recommendation. Like Kabab, show all the restuarants with the top being the highest review.  

This is more of user centric application and might not necessairily promote the restaurants.
